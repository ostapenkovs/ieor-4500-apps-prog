    "The basic premise is as follows. Suppose that we consider a pair $(i,j)$ of assets. When we invest $S_k$ on this pair, we do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We take the position $S_k$ in asset $i$.\n",
    "- We take the position $-S_k$ in asset $j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The worth of this position is judged as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The number of shares in asset $i$ equals $k/p_i^t$.\n",
    "- The value of the position in asset $i$, at time $t+1$, equals $kp_i^{t+1}/p_i^t$.\n",
    "- The value of the position in asset $j$, at time $t+1$, equals $-kp_j^{t+1}/p_j^t$.\n",

    "Hence, if we close the pair position at time $t+1$, the value we accrue (gain or loss) equals\n",

    "\n",
    "Conceptually, you may have thought, throughout, that $k > 0$, i.e., we are longing $i$ and shorting $j$. However, make sure you understand that the formula is correct if $k < 0$, i.e., we short $i$ and long $j$.\n",
